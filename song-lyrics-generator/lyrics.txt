Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again even if it's just  in your wildest dreams .
In your wildest dreams .
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams .
In your wildest dreams . ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life, tell me how's your family.
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier then ever.
We small talk, work and the weather.
Your guard is up and I know why.Because the last time you saw me.
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.So this is me swallowing my pride.
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.These days I haven't been sleeping.
Staying up playing back myself leaving.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times.
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.So this is me swallowing my pride.
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time.I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right.
And how you held me in your arms that September night.
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking.
Probably mindless dreaming.
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.But this is me swallowing my pride.
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time all the time. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I'm five years old.
It's getting cold.
I've got my big coat on.I hear your laugh.
And look up smiling at you.
I run and run.
Past the pumpkin patch.
And the tractor rides.
Look now, the sky is gold.
I hug your legs.
And fall asleep on the way home.I don't know why all the trees change in the fall.
But I know you're not scared of anything at all.
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away.
But I know I had the best day with you today.I'm thirteen now.
And don't know how.
My friends could be so mean.
I come home crying.
And you hold me tight.
And grab the keys.And we drive and drive.
Until we found a town far enough away.
And we talk and window shop.
'Till I forgotten all their names.I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school.
But I know I'm laughing.
On the car ride home with you.
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay.
But I know I had the best day with you today.I have an excellent father.
His strength is making me stronger.
God smiles on my little brother.
Inside and out he's better than I am.
I grew up in a pretty house.
And I had space to run and I.
had the best days with you.There is a video I found.
From back when I was three.
You set up a paint set in the kitchen.
And you're talking to me.
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships.
And the seven dwarfs.
And Daddy's smart.
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world.And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall.
I know you were on my side.
Even when I was wrong.
And I love you for giving me your eyes.
Staying back and watching me shine and.I didn't know if you knew.
So I'm taking this chance to say.
That I had the best day with you today.. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG You, with your words like knives.
And swords and weapons that you use against me.
You, have knocked me off my feet again,.
Got me feeling like a nothing.
You, with your voice like nails.
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded.
You, picking on the weaker man.You can take me down.
With just one single blow.
But you don't know what you don't know.Someday I'll be living in a big old city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean.You, with your switching sides.
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation.
You have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them.
I walk with my head down,.
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you.
I just want to feel okay again.I bet you got pushed around.
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now.
'Cause you can't lead me down that road.
And you don't know what you don't know.Someday I'll be living in a big old city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean.And I can see you years from now in a bar.
Talking over a football game.
With that same big loud opinion.
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting.
About the same old bitter things.
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing.
But all you are is mean.
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic.
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean.But someday I'll be living in a big old city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Yeah someday I'll be big enough.
So you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so .
Someday I'll be living in a big old city.
.And all you're ever gonna be is mean.

Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.

Why you gotta be so mean. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors.
It's the morning of your very first day.
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while.
Try and stay out of everybody's way.It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here.
For the next four years in this town.
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say.
"You know, I haven't seen you around before".'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you.
You're gonna believe them.
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out but.
count to ten, take it in.
This is life before you know who you're gonna be.
Fifteen.You sit in class next to redheaded Abigail.
And soon enough you're best friends.
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool.
We'll be outta here as soon as we can.And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car.
And you feeling like flying.
And your mama's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one.
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends.
When the night ends.'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you.
You're gonna believe them.
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss.
Makes your head spin around.
But in your life you'll do things greater than.
Dating the boy on the football team.
I didn't know it at fifteen.When all you wanted was to be wanted.
I wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now.Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday.
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine.
Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind.
We both cried.'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you.
You're gonna believe them.
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to love before you fall.
I've found time can heal most anything.
And you just might find who you're supposed to be.
I didn't know who I was supposed to be.
Fifteen.la la la la la.
Your very first day.
Take a deep breath girl.
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I remember when we broke up the first time.
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like.
We hadn't seen each other in a month.
When you said you needed space. .
Then you come around again and say.
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.".
Remember how that lasted for a day.
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you.".Ooh, we called it off again last night.

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,.
The jury's out,.
And my choice is you..So don't you worry your pretty little mind,.
People throw rocks at things that shine,.

That I can't even see anyone when he's with me.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,.
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe.
And there he goes, so perfectly,.
The kind of flawless I wish I could be.
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love.
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause.He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light.
I'll put his picture down and maybe.
Get some sleep tonight.Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough.
And he's all that I need to fall into.Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles.
Same old tired, lonely place.
Walls of insincerity.
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face.
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you.Your eyes whispered "have we met".
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me.
The playful conversation starts.
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy.
And it was enchanting to meet you.
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you.This night is sparkling, don't you let it go.
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home.
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew.

Not where the story line ends.
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again.

As we're lyin' on the couch.
The moment, I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water.
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine.Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together.
And there's a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded.
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.And we got bills to pay.
We got nothin' figured out.
When it was hard to take.

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine.Oh, oh, oh, oh.And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m..
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands.
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street.Braced myself for the goodbye,.
'Cause that's all I've ever known.
Then, you took me by surprise.
You said, "I'll never leave you alone".You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water..
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time..
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter..
She is the best thing that's ever been mine.".You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.

But you changed the rules every day.
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone.
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why.Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with.
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known.Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame.
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand.
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can".Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with.
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong.
Don't you think nineteen is too young.
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so.
I should've known.You are an expert at sorry,.
And keeping the lines blurry.
Never impressed by me acing your tests.

Have tired, lifeless eyes.
'Cause you burned them out.
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,.
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town.Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.

And that magic's not here no more,.
And I might be okay,.
But I'm not fine at all..'Cause there we are again on that little town street..
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me..
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well..Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red..
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed.
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team.
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me..And I know it's long gone.
And there was nothing else I could do.
And I forget about you long enough.
To forget why I needed to.'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night..
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light.
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah..Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,.
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up..
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well..Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise..
So casually cruel in the name of being honest..
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here.
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well..Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it.
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it.
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own.
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone.But you keep my old scarf from that very first week.
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah.'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so.
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known.
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well.Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all.
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all.
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG The way you move is like a full on rainstorm.
And I'm a house of cards.
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running.
But I kinda know that I won't get far.And you stood there in front of me just.
Close enough to touch.
Close enough to hope you couldn't see.
What I was thinking of.Drop everything now.
Meet me in the pouring rain.
Kiss me on the sidewalk.
Take away the pain.
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile.Get me with those green eyes, baby.
As the lights go down.
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around.
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile.My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea.
You touch me once and it's really something.
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world.
But with you I know its no good.
And I could wait patiently.
But I really wish you would.Drop everything now.
Meet me in the pouring rain.
Kiss me on the sidewalk.
Take away the pain.
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile.Get me with those green eyes, baby.
As the lights go down.
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around.
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile.I run my fingers through your hair.
And watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me.
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase.
Won't you whisper soft and slow.
And I'm captivated by you baby.
Like a fireworks show.Drop everything now.
Meet me in the pouring rain.
Kiss me on the sidewalk.
Take away the pain.
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile.Get me with those green eyes, baby.
As the lights go down.
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around.
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile.When sparks fly oh baby smile.
When sparks fly. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I still remember the look on your face.
Lit through the darkness at 1:58.
The words that you whispered.
For just us to know.
You told me you loved me.
So why did you go.
Away.
Away.I do recall now.
The smell of the rain.
Fresh on the pavement.
I ran off the plane.
That July ninth.
The beat of your heart.
It jumps through your shirt.
I can still feel your arms.But now I'll go sit on the floor.
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is.
I don't know how to be something you missed.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name, forever the name on my lips.I do remember.
The swing in your step.
The life of the party, you're showing off again.
And I roll my eyes and then.
You pull me in.
I'm not much for dancing.
But for you I did.Because I love your handshake.
Meetin' my father.
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets.
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something.
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.And I'll go sit on the floor.
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is that.
I don't know how to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name, forever the name on my lips.So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep.
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe.
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are.
Hope it's nice where you are.And I hope the sun shines.
And it's a beautiful day.
And something reminds you.
You wish you had stayed.
You can plan for a change in weather and time.
But I never planned on you changing your mind.So I'll go sit on the floor.
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is that.
I don't know how to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name, forever the name on my lips.Just like our last kiss.
Forever the name on my lips.
Forever the name on my lips.
Just like our last. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow.
Let it take me where it wants.
'Til you opened the door, there's so much more.
I've never seen it before.
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings.
But you came along and you changed everything.You lift my feet off the ground.
You spin me around.
You make me crazier crazier.
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes.
You make me crazier crazier crazier.I watched from a distance as you made life your own.
Every sky was your own kind of blue.
And I wanted to know how that would feel.
And you made it so real.
You showed me something that I couldn't see.
You opened my eyes and you made me believe..You lift my feet off the ground.
You spin me around.
You make me crazier crazier.
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes.
You make me crazier,crazier,crazier oh.Baby you showed me what livin' is for.
I don't wanna hide anymore.You lift my feet off the ground.
You spin me around.
You make me crazier crazier.
Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes.
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier.
Crazier, crazier. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
And we caught onto something.
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.Were you just kidding.
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down.
We almost never speak.
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby what happened Please tell me.'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door.Was I out of line.
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide.
Like a scared little boy.
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure.So here's to everything coming down to nothing.
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core.
Where is this going Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore.You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so.Oh back up, baby, back up.
Did you forget everything.
Back up, baby, back up.
Did you forget everything.'Cause it rains in your bedroom.
Everything is wrong.
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always.Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called.
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all.
And you flashback to when we said forever and always.And it rains in your bedroom.
Everything is wrong.
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always.
You didn't mean it baby,.
You said forever and always, yeah.. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car.
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel.
The other on my heart.
I look around, turn the radio down.
He says, "Baby, is something wrong".
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song".
And he said,.Our song is a slamming screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window.
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow.
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date.
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have.
And when I got home, before I said amen.
Asking God if he could play it again.I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day.
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on.
And lost and thrown away.
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed.
I almost didn't notice all the roses.
And the note that said,.Our song is a slamming screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window.
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow.
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date.
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have.
And when I got home, before I said amen.
Asking God if he could play it again.I've heard every album, listened to the radio.
Waited for something to come along.
That was as good as our song.'Cause our song is a slamming screen door.
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window.
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow.
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know.
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date.
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have.
And when I got home, before I said amen.
Asking God if he could play it again.
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah.I was riding shotgun with my hair undone.
In the front seat of his car.
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin.
And I wrote down our song. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us.
How we met and the sparks flew instantly.
People would say, "they're the lucky ones".I used to know my place was a spot next to you.
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat.
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.Oh, a simple complication.
Miscommunications lead to fall out.
So many things that I wish you knew.
So many walls up I can't break through.Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room.
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know.
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah.
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate.
When it all broke down and the story of us.
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter.How'd we end up this way.
See me nervously pulling at my clothes.
And trying to look busy.
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us.
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here.
But you held your pride like you should have held me.
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending.
Why are we pretending this is nothing.
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how.
I've never heard silence quite this loud.Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room.
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know.
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah.
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate.
When it all broke down and the story of us.
Looks a lot like a tragedy now.This is looking like a contest.
Of who can act like they care less.
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now.
But I would lay my armor down.
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew.
But the story of us might be ending soon.Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room.
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know.
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah.
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate.
When it all broke down and the story of us.
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone.In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream.
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone.In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream.
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, oh.In the middle of the night waking from this dream.

Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh.Like a million little stars spelling out your name.
They're spelling out your name, oh. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I said remember this moment.
In the back of my mind.
The time we stood with our shaking hands.
The crowds in stands went wild.
We were the kings and the queens.
And they read off our names.
The night you danced like you knew our lives.
Would never be the same.
You held your head like a hero.
On a history book page.
It was the end of a decade.
But the start of an age.Long live the walls we crashed through.
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made".
And bring on all the pretenders.
One day we will be remembered.I said remember this feeling.
I passed the pictures around.
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines.
Wishing for right now.
We are the kings and the queens.
You traded your baseball cap for a crown.
When they gave us our trophies.
And we held them up for our town.
And the cynics were outraged.
Screaming, "this is absurd".
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world.Long live the walls we crashed through.
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made".
And bring on all the pretenders.
I'm not afraid.Long live all the mountains we moved.
I had the time of my life.
Fighting dragons with you.
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face".
And bring on all the pretenders.
One day we will be remembered.Hold on to spinning around.
Confetti falls to the ground.
May these memories break our fall.Can you take a moment.
Promise me this:.
That you'll stand by me forever.
But if God forbid fate should step in.
And force us into a goodbye.
If you have children someday.
When they point to the pictures.
Please tell them my name.
Tell them how the crowds went wild.
Tell them how I hope they shine.Long live the walls we crashed through.
I had the time of my life with you.Long, long live the walls we crashed through.
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made".
And bring on all the pretenders.
I'm not afraid.Singing long live all the mountains we moved.
I had the time of my life.
Fighting dragons with you.
And long, long live the look on your face.
And bring on all the pretenders.
One day, we will be remembered. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.
Ha, time for a little revenge.The story starts when it was hot and it was summer.
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him.
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause.
She took him faster than you could say sabotage.
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it.
I underestimated just who I was dealing with.
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum.
She underestimated just who she was stealing from.She's not a saint and she's not what you think.
She's an actress, whoa.
She's better known for the things that she does.
On the mattress, whoa.
Soon she's gonna find.
Stealing other people's toys on the playground.
Won't make you many friends.
She should keep in mind,.
She should keep in mind.
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha.She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list.
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it.
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling.
And, she thinks I'm psycho.
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but.
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know.
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go.
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school.
So it's up to me.
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity.
.She's not a saint and she's not what you think.
She's an actress, whoa.
She's better known for the things that she does.
On the mattress, whoa.
Soon she's gonna find.
Stealing other people's toys on the playground.
Won't make you many friends.
She should keep in mind,.
She should keep in mind.
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha.I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey.
You might have him, but haven't you heard.
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey.
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word.
Whoa.She's not a saint and she's not what you think.

Stealing other people's toys on the playground.

'Cause I don't think you do, oh.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing.
I don't think you do, I don't think you do.

C'mon show me how much better you are.
See you deserve some applause.
'Cause you're so much better.

Hoping you would come around.
I've been giving out chances every time.
And all you do is let me down.
And it's taking me this long.
Baby but I figured you out.
And you're thinking we'll be fine again.
But not this time around.You don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore.
And you can tell me that you're sorry.
But I don't believe you baby.
Like I did before.
You're not sorry, no no, no no.Looking so innocent.
I might believe you if I didn't know.
Could've loved you all my life.
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold.
And you got your share of secrets.
And I'm tired of being last to know.
And now you're asking me to listen.
Cause it's worked each time before.But you don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore.
And you can tell me that you're sorry.
But I don't believe you baby.
Like I did before.
You're not sorry, no no.You're not sorry, no no.You had me crawling for you honey.
And it never would've gone away, no.
You used to shine so bright.
But I watched all of it fade.You don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw there's nothing left to beg for.
And you can tell me that you're sorry.
But I don't believe you baby.

No, no, no.You're not sorry, no no . ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG There's somethin' bout the way.
The street looks when it's just rained.
There's a glow off the pavement.
Walk me to the car.
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there.
In the middle of the parking lot.
Yeah.We're drivin' down the road.
I wonder if you know.
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now.
But you're just so cool.
Run your hands through your hair.
Absent mindedly makin' me want you.And I don't know how it gets better than this.
You take my hand and drag me head first.
Fearless.
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance.
In a storm in my best dress.
Fearless.So baby drive slow.
Til we run out of road in this one horse town.
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat.
You put your eyes on me.
In this moment now capture it remember it.And I don't know how it gets better than this.
You take my hand and drag me head first.
Fearless.
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance.
In a storm in my best dress.
Fearless.Well you stood there with me in the doorway.

I'm not usually this way but.
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave.
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless..And I don't know how it gets better than this.
You take my hand and drag me head first.
Fearless.
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance.

He didn't like it when I wore high heels.
But I do.
Turn the lock and put my headphones on.
He always said he didn't get this song.
But I do, I do.Walked in expecting you'd be late.
But you got here early and you stand and wave.
I walk to you.
You pull my chair out and help me in.
And you don't know how nice that is.
But I do.And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did.
I've been spending the last eight months.
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end.
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.You said you never met one girl.
Who had as many James Taylor records as you.
But I do.
We tell stories and you don't know why.
I'm coming off a little shy.
But I do.But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did.I've been spending the last eight months.
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end.
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up.
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches.
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that.
And for the first time what's past is past.'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did.

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Last night I heard my own heart beating.
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs.
Six months gone and I'm still reaching.
Even though I know you're not there.I was playing back a thousand memories, baby.
Thinkin' 'bout everythin' we've been through.
Maybe I've been goin' back too much lately.
When time stood still and I had you.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You would, you would if this was a movie.
Stand in the rain outside.
'Til I came out.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry.
I know that we could work it out somehow.
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now.I know people change and these things happen.
But I remember how it was back then.
Locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing.
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them.Now, I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street.
Flashback to the night when you said to me.
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you ".
Not before I knew how much I had to lose.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You would, you would if this was a movie.
Stand in the rain outside.
'Til I came out.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry.
I know that we could work it out somehow.
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now.If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on.
I've be waiting for you ever since you've been gone.
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.And I say come back, come back, come back to me like.
You would before you said it's not that easy.
Before the fight, before I locked you out.
But I'd take it all back now.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You would, you would if this was a movie.
Stand in the rain outside.
'Til I came out.Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You could, you could if you just said sorry.
I know that we could work it out somehow.
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now.You'd be here by now.
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now.
Baby, what about the ending.
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now.That you'd be here by now. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG The drought was the very worst, ah ah.
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst.
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah.
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore.
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm.Rain came pouring down when I was drowning.
That's when I could finally breathe.
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean.There was nothing left to do, ah ah.
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room.
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah.
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you.
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing.Rain came pouring down when I was drowning.
That's when I could finally breathe.
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean.
I think I am finally clean, ah.
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah.Ten months sober, I must admit.
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it.
Ten months older I won't give in.
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it.The drought was the very worst, ah ah.

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me.
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds.

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night.
I said: "That's a lie.".
Just a boy in a Chevy truck.
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck.
On back roads at night.
And I was right there beside him all summer long.
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone.But when you think "Tim McGraw".
I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long.
The moon like a spotlight on the lake.
When you think happiness.
I hope you think "that little black dress".
Think of my head on your chest.
And my old faded blue jeans.
When you think Tim McGraw.
I hope you think of me.September saw a month of tears.
And thankin' God that you weren't here.
To see me like that.
But in a box beneath my bed.
Is a letter that you never read.
From three summers back.
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet.
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe.But when you think "Tim McGraw".
I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long.
The moon like a spotlight on the lake.
When you think happiness.
I hope you think "that little black dress".
Think of my head on your chest.
And my old faded blue jeans.
When you think Tim McGraw.
I hope you think of me.And I'm back for the first time since then.
I'm standin' on your street.
And there's a letter left on your doorstep.
And the first thing that you'll read.Is when you think "Tim McGraw".
I hope you think my favorite song.
Someday you'll turn your radio on.
I hope it takes you back to that place.

Busy streets and busy lives.
And all we know is touch and go.
We are alone with our changing minds.
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time.And I never saw you coming.
And I'll never be the same.You come around and the armor falls.
Pierce the room like a cannon ball.
Now all we know, is dont let go.
We are alone just you and me.
Up in your room and our slates are clean.
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes.So you were never a saint..
And I love in shades of wrong.
We learn to live with the pain..
Mosaic broken hearts.
But this love is brave and wild..And I never saw you coming.
And I'll never be the same.This is a state of grace.
This is the worth while fight.
Love is a ruthless game.
Unless you play it good and right.
These are the hands of fate.
Your'e my Achilles heel.
This is the golden age of something good.
And right and real.And I never saw you coming.
And I'll never be the same.And I never saw you coming.

He tells me about his night.
And I count the colors in his eyes.He'll never fall in love he swears.
As he runs his fingers through his hair.
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong.
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind.
He tells a joke I fake a smile.
That I know all his favorite songs and.I could tell you his favorite color's green.
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth.
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes.
And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie.He looks around the room.
Innocently overlooks the truth.
Shouldn't a light go on.
Doesn't he know I've had him memorized for so long.He sees everything black and white.
Never let nobody see him cry.
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine.I could tell you his favorite color's green.
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth.
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes.
And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie.He stands there then walks away.
My God, if I could only say.
I'm holding every breath for you.
He'd never tell you but he can play guitar.
I think he can see through everything but my heart.
First thought when I wake up is, "My god, he's beautiful".
So I put on my make up and pray for a miracle.Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green.
He loves to argue oh and it kills me.
His sisters beautiful he has his father's eyes.
And if you asked me if I love him.
If you ask me if I love him, I'd lie. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.

That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk.".And I said,.
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers.
That took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to.Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.You took the time to memorize me.
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave.
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life.Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad.

You should've known that word.
But what you did with her get back to me.And I should've been there in the back of your mind.
I shouldn't be asking myself why.
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet.
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me.You can see that I've been crying.
And baby you know all the right things to say.
But do you honestly expect me to believe.
We could ever be the same.You say that the past is the past, you need one chance.

That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up.
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us.
To every single time that they play this song.
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us.
When the tides get too high.
And the sea up underneath get so deep.
And you feel like you're just another person.
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed.
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us.
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up.
And even though we always against the odds.
These are the things that have molded us.
And if life hadn't chosen us.
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up.
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint.
Then build it from the ground up, hey.
But if it's all for one, and one for all.
Then maybe one day, we all can ball.
Do it one time for the underdogs.
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Last Christmas I gave you my heart.

Tell me baby.
Do you recognize me.
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it.
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it.
Now I know what a fool I've been.
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again.Last Christmas I gave you my heart.

I'll give it to someone special.A crowded room and friends with tired eyes.
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice.
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on.
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart.
Maybe this year.
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special.'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart.
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears.

Stumbled through the long goodbye,.
One last kiss, then catch your flight,.

But in my mind I play it back,.
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,.And this is when the feeling sinks in,.
I don't wanna miss you like this,.
Come back, be here, come back, be here..

I don't wanna need you this way,.
Come back, be here, come back, be here..The delicate beginning rush,.
The feeling you can know so much,.
Without knowing anything at all..
And now that I can put this down,.
If I had known what I know now,.
I never would have played so nonchalant..Taxi cabs and busy streets,.
That never bring you back to me,.
I can't help but wish you took me with you,.And this is when the feeling sinks in,.
I don't wanna miss you like this,.
Come back, be here, come back, be here..
I guess you're in London today,.
And I don't wanna need you this way,.
Come back, be here, come back, be here..This is falling in love in the cruelest way,.
This is falling for you and you are worlds away..New York, be here..

I used to care, but things have changed.This place ain't doing me any good.
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag.
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag.
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove.Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too.
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through.People are crazy and times are strange.
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.I've been walking forty miles of bad road.
If the bible is right, the world will explode.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Some things are too hot to touch.
The human mind can only stand so much.
You can't win with a losing hand.Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet.
Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street.People are crazy and times are strange.
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed.I hurt easy, I just don't show it.
You can hurt someone and not even know it.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high.
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie.
I'm love with a woman who don't even appeal to me.Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.People are crazy and times are strange.
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range.
I used to care, but things have changed. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night.
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood.
Cries out my God, they killed them all.
Here comes the story of the Hurricane.
The man the authorities came to blame.
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been.
The champion of the world.Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see.
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
I didn't do it, he says, and he throws up his hands.
I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops.
One of us had better call up the cops.
And so Patty calls the cops.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'.
In the hot New Jersey night.Meanwhile, far away in another part of town.
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown.
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down.
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street.
'Less you want to draw the heat.Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around.
He said, I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights.
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead.
So they took him to the infirmary.
And though this man could hardly see.
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye.
Says, wha'd you bring him in here for He ain't the guy.
Here's the story of the Hurricane.
The man the authorities came to blame.
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been.
The champion of the world.Four months later, the ghettos are in flame.
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name.
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game.
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
Remember that murder that happened in a bar.
Remember you said you saw the getaway car.
You think you'd like to play ball with the law.
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night.
Don't forget that you are white.Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure.
The cops said a poor boy like you could use a break.
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello.
You don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir.
We want to pin this triple murder on him.
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.Rubin could take a man out with just one punch.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay.
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way.
Up to some paradise.
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice.
And ride a horse along a trail.
But then they took him to the jailhouse.
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance.
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums.
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum.
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed.
And the all-white jury agreed.Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder one, guess who testified.
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied.
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man.
Be in the palm of some fool's hand.
To see him obviously framed.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land.
Where justice is a game.Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties.
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise.
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell.
An innocent man in a living hell.
That's the story of the Hurricane.
But it won't be over till they clear his name.
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been.
The champion of the world. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe.
If you dont know by now.
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe.
It don't matter anyhow.When your rooster crows at the break of dawn.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You're the reason I'm travelin' along.
Don't think twice, it's alright.Well, it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe.
That light I never knowed.
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe.
I'm on the dark side of the road.Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
But we never did too much talkin' anyway.
So don't think twice, it's alright.It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal.
Like you never did before.
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal.
I can't hear you any more.I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' walkin down the road.
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told.
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul.
But don't think twice, it's alright.So I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road, babe.
Where I'm bound, I can't tell.
But goodbye's too good a word, babe.
So I'll just say fare thee well.I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind.
You could have done better but I don't mind.
You just kinda wasted my precious time.
But don't think twice, it's alright. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG See the pyramids along the Nile.
Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle.
Just remember, darling all the while.
You belong to me.See the marketplace in old Algiers.
Send me photographs and souvenirs.
Just remember when a dream appears.
You belong to me.I'll be so alone without you.
Maybe you'll be lonesome too.
And blue.Fly the ocean in a silver plane.
See the jungle when it's wet with rain.
Just remember 'til you're home again.
You belong to me.[instrumental verse, as intro].I'll be so alone without you.
Maybe you'll be lonesome too.
And blue.Fly the ocean in a silver plane.
See the jungle when it's wet with rain.
Just remember 'til you're home again.
You belong to me.Juliette Lewis: "I just want to tell you I love you, and I miss you. Don't.

And the whole world is on your case.
I could offer a warm embrace.
To make you feel my love.When evening shadows and the stars appear.
And there is no one there to dry your tears.
I could hold you for a million years.
To make you feel my love.I know you haven't made your mind up yet.
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue.
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
And oh, there's nothing that I wouldn't do.
To make you feel my love.The storms are raging on the rolling sea.
And on the highway of regret.
The winds of change are blowing wild and free.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the earth for you.
To make you feel my love. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps.
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps.
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I, proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, "rip down all hate," I screamed.
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed.
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy.
To memorizing politics of ancient history.
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now.A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool.
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school.
"Equality," I spoke the word as if a wedding vow.
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach.
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach.
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect.
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect.
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG There must be some way out of here.
Said the joker to the thief.
There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine.
Plowmen dig my earth.
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.No reason to get excited,the thief, he kindly spoke.
There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate.
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.All along the watchtower, princes kept the view.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG If today was not a crooked highway.
If tonight was not a crooked trail.
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time.
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.
Yes and only if my own true love was waitin'.
And if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'.
Yes, only if she was lyin' by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.I can't see my reflection in the waters.
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain.
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps.
Or remember the sound of my own name.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin'.
And if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'.
Yes and only if she was lyin' by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.There's beauty in the silver, singin' river.
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky.
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Yes and only if my own true love was waitin'.
I could hear her heart a softly poundin'.
Yes and only if she was lyin' by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG May God's bless and keep you always.

And as for compensation, there's a little he would ask.
Take a woman like you.
To get through to the man in me.Storm clouds are raging all around my door.
I think to myself I might not take it any more.
Take a woman like your kind.
To find the man in me.But, oh, what a wonderful feeling.
Just to know that you are near.
It sets my a heart a reeling.
From my toes up to my ears.The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen.
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you.
To get through to the man in me. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG If you're travelin' in the North Country fair.
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline.
Remember me to one who lives there.
For she once was a true love of mine.If you go when the snowflakes storm.
When the rivers freeze and summer ends.
Please see she has a coat so warm.
To keep her from the howlin' winds.Please see if her hair hangs long.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long.
For that's the way I remember her best.I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed.
In the darkness of my night.
In the brightness of my day. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Your breath is sweet.
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth.
On the pillow where you lie.
But I don't sense affection.
No gratitude or love.
Your loyalty is not to me.
But to the stars above.One more cup of coffee for the road.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
To the valley below.Your daddy he's an outlaw.
And a wanderer by trade.
He'll teach you how to pick and choose.
And how to throw the blade.
He oversees his kingdom.
So no stranger does intrude.
His voice it trembles as he calls out.
For another plate of food.One more cup of coffee for the road.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
To the valley below.Your sister sees the future.
Like your mama and yourself.
You've never learned to read or write.
There's no books upon your shelf.
And your pleasure knows no limits.
Your voice is like a meadowlark.
But your heart is like an ocean.
Mysterious and dark.One more cup of coffee for the road.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
To the valley below. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'.
I was layin' in bed.
Wondrin' if she'd changed at all.
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together.
Sure was gonna be rough.
They never did like.
Mama's homemade dress.
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road.
Rain fallin' on my shoes.
Heading out for the east coast.
Lord knows I've paid some dues.
Gettin' through.
Tangled up in blue.She was married when we first met.
Soon to be divorced.
I helped her out of a jam I guess.
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could.
Abandoned it out west.
Split up on a dark sad night.
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me.
As I was walkin' away.
I heard her say over my shoulder.
We'll meet again some day.
On the avenue.
Tangled up in blue.I had a job in the great north woods.
Working as a cook for a spell.
But I never did like it all that much.
And one day the axe just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans.
Where I was looking for to be employed.
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat.
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone.
The past was close behind.
I seen a lot of women.
But she never escaped my mind.
And I just grew.
Tangled up in blue.She was workin' in a topless place.
And I stopped in for a beer.
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face.
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out.
I's just about to do the same.
She was standing there in back of my chair.
Said to me, Don't I know your name.
I muttered somethin' under my breath.
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy.
When she bent down to tie the laces.
Of my shoe.
Tangled up in blue.She lit a burner on the stove.
And offered me a pipe.
I thought you'd never say hello, she said.
You look like the silent type.
Then she opened up a book of poems.
And handed it to me.
Written by an Italian poet.
From the thirteenth century.
And everyone of them words rang true.
And glowed like burnin' coal.
Pourin' off of every page.
Like it was written in my soul.
From me to you.
Tangled up in blue.I lived with them on Montague Street.
In a basement down the stairs.
There was music in the cafes at night.
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves.
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned.
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out.
I became withdrawn.
The only thing I knew how to do.
Was to keep on keepin' on.
Like a bird that flew.
Tangled up in blue.So now I'm goin' back again.
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know.
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians.
Some are carpenters' wives.
Don't know how it all got started.
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road.
Headin' for another joint.
We always did feel the same.
We just saw it from a different point.
Of view.
Tangled up in blue. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Come you masters of war.
You that build the big guns.
You that build the death planes.
You that build all the bombs.
You that hide behind walls.
You that hide behind desks.
I just want you to know.
I can see through your masks.You that never done nothin'.
But build to destroy.
You play with my world.
Like it's your little toy.
You put a gun in my hand.
And you hide from my eyes.
And you turn and run farther.
When the fast bullets fly.Like Judas of old.
You lie and deceive.
A world war can be won.
You want me to believe.
But I see through your eyes.
And I see through your brain.
Like I see through the water.
That runs down my drain.You fasten all the triggers.
For the others to fire.
Then you sit back and watch.
When the death count gets higher.
You hide in your mansion.
While the young people's blood.
Flows out of their bodies.
And is buried in the mud.You've thrown the worst fear.
That can ever be hurled.
Fear to bring children.
Into the world.
For threatening my baby.
Unborn and unnamed.
You ain't worth the blood.
That runs in your veins.How much do I know.
To talk out of turn.
You might say that I'm young.
You might say I'm unlearned.
But there's one thing I know.
Though I'm younger than you.
That even Jesus would never.
Forgive what you do.Let me ask you one question.
Is your money that good.
Will it buy you forgiveness.
Do you think that it could.
I think you will find.
When your death takes its toll.
All the money you made.
Will never buy back your soul.And I hope that you die.
And your death'll come soon.
I will follow your casket.
By the pale afternoon.
And I'll watch while you're lowered.
Down to your deathbed.
And I'll stand o'er your grave.

They'll stone you when you're tryna keep your seat.
They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor.
They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door.But I would not feel so all alone.
Everybody must get stoned.They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table.
They'll stone you when you are young and able.
They'll stone you when you're tryna make a buck.
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck".Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone.
Everybody must get stoned.Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.Yes but I would not feel so all alone.
Everybody must get stoned, alright.Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone.
They'll stone you when you are walkin' home.

I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests.
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans.
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard.
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son.
And what did you see, my darling young one.
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it.
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it.
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'.
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'.
I saw a white ladder all covered with water.
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken.
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children.
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son.
And what did you hear, my darling young one.
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin'.
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world.
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'.
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'.
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'.
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter.
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley.
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son.
Who did you meet, my darling young one.
I met a young child beside a dead pony.
I met a white man who walked a black dog.
I met a young woman whose body was burning.
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow.
I met one man who was wounded in love.
I met another man who was wounded with hatred.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown.

And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to go.
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row.Cinderella, she seems so easy, "It takes one to know one," she smiles.
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style.
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. "You Belong to Me I Believe".
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave".
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide.
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame.Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so afraid.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a trunk.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Now he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette.
And he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole.
And she also keeps the cards that read, "Have Mercy on His Soul".
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
They are spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know".
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row".At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine.
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene.
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn.
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on".
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower.
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers.
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.Yes, I received your letter yesterday, about the time the doorknob broke.
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke.
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters no.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Go 'way from my window.

Someone to open each and every door.
But it ain't me, babe.
No, no, no, it ain't me babe.
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.Go lightly from the ledge, babe.
Go lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I will only let your down.
You say you're lookin' for someone.
Who will promise never to part.
Someone to close his eyes for you.
Someone to close his heart.
Someone who will die for you an' more.
But it ain't me, babe.
No, no, no, it ain't me babe.
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.Go melt back in the night.
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving.
An' anyway I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone.
Who'll pick you up each time you fall.
To gather flowers constantly.
An' to come each time you call.
A lover for your life an' nothing more.

No, no, no, it ain't me, babe.

Let's take a chance, who really cares.
Why don't you know, you got nothin' to prove.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.Why wait any longer, I don't mean too complain.
You can have love but you might lose it.
Why run any longer when you're runnin' in vain.
You can have the truth but you got to choose it.Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.

I shall be released.Down here next to me in this lonely crowd.
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him cry so loud.
Calling out that he's been framed.
I see my light come shining.

Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.Remember one evening, it was drizzlin' rain.
And in my heart, I felt an achin' pain.
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.Once I wore my apron low.
Couldn't keep' you away from my door.
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.Now, my apron is up to my chin.
You pass my door but you never come in.
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild.

It's never been this close before.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I've been shooting in the dark too long.
When somethin's not right it's wrong.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.Dragon clouds so high above.
I've only known careless love.
It's always hit me from below.
This time around it's more correct.
Right on target, so direct.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.Purple clover, Queen Anne lace.
Crimson hair across your face.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of.
You might be spoilin' me too much, love.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy.
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme.
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy.
I could stay with you forever.
And never realize the time.Situations have ended sad.
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
But there's no way I can compare.
All those scenes to this affair.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doin'.
Stayin' far behind without you.
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin'.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.I'll look for you in old Honolul-a.
San Francisco, Ashtabula.
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above.
In the tall grass, in the ones I love.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG 'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood.
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud.
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured.
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word.
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved.
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved.
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail.
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail.
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there.
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost.
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed.
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount.
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts.
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove.
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love.
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes.
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose.
I offered up my innocence I got repaid with scorn.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm.Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line.
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine.
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born.
Come in, she said.
I'll give ya shelter from the storm. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Thing's all right and she's all too tight.
In my neighborhood she cries both day and night.
I know it because I was there.
It's a milestone but she's down on her luck.
And she's daily salooning about to make her hard earned buck.
I was there.I believe where she'd stop him if she wants time to care.
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care.
And I'd go by the Lord and when she's on my way.
But I don't belong there.No, I don't belong to her, I don't belong to anybody.
She's my Christ forsaken angel but she don't hear me cry.
She's a lone hearted mystic and she cant carry on.
When I'm there she's alright but then she's not when I'm gone.Heaven knows that the answer, she's don't calling no one.
She's the way, her sailing beauty for she's mine for the one.
And I lost her hesitating by temptation lest it runs.
But she don't holler me but I'm not there, I'm gone.Now I'll cry tonight like I cried the night before.
And I'm released on the heights in but I'll dream about the door.
It's alone, she's forsaken by her fate, worse to tell.
"It don't have approximation", she smiled, "Fare thee well".Now when Ill teach that lady I was born to love her.
But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her.
And I run but I race but it's not too fast or slow.
But I dont perceive her, I'm not there, I'm gone.Well, it's all about confusion and I cry for her.
Well, I dont need anybody now beside me to tell.
And its all affirmation I receive but its not.
Shes adorned by the beauty but she don't like the spot and she won't.Yes, she's gone like the rainbow that shined yesterday.
But now she's home beside me and I'd like her here to stay.
She's a lone forsaken beauty and it's don't trust anyone.
I wish I was beside her but I'm not there, I'm gone.Well, it's too hard to stay here and I don't want to leave.
Its so bad but amusing when shes hard, too hard to leave.
Its a load, its a crime the way she haunt me around.
But she told, Wont you hate me but [Incomprehensible].Yes, I believe that its rightful, oh, I believe it in my mind.

It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.

I've still got the scars that the sun didn't let me heal.There's not even room enough to be anywhere.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain.
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain.She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind.
She put down in writin' what was in her mind.
I just don't see why I should even care.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.Well I been to London and I been to gay Paree.
I followed the river and I got to the sea.
I've been down to the bottom of a whirlpool of lies.
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes.Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.I was born here and I'll die here, against my will.
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still.Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb.

She might be in Tangier.
She left here last early spring.
Is living there I hear.Say for me that I'm all right.
Though things get kind of slow.

Don't tell her it isn't so.We had a falling-out.
Like lovers often will.
And to think of how she left that night.
It still brings me a chill.And though our separation.
It pierced me to the heart.
She still lives inside of me.
We've never been apart.If you get close to her.
Kiss her once for me.
I always have respected her.
For doing what she did and getting free.Oh, whatever makes her happy.
I won't stand in the way.
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on.
From the night I tried to make her stay.I see a lot of people.
As I make the rounds.
And I hear her name here and there.
As I go from town to town.And I've never gotten used to it.
I've just learned to turn it off.
Either I'm too sensitive.
Or else I'm getting soft.Sundown yellow moon.
I replay the past.
I know every scene by heart.

I'm not that hard to find.
Tell her she can look me up.
If she's got the time. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Maybe, it's the color of the sun cut flat.

It don't even matter, where you're wakin' up tomorrow.
Mama, you just on my mind.When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.

I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.Got nothing for you, I had nothing before.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Sky full of fire, pain pourin' down.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Only one thing I did wrong.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall.
Say anything you want to, I have heard it all.
I was thinkin' about the things that Rosie said.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
So many things that we never will undo.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.Some people will offer you their hand and some won't.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
I need somethin' strong to distract my mind.
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind.Well, I got here following the southern star.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
Only one thing I did wrong.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast.
I'm drownin' in the poison, got no future, got no past.

Everybody got to move somewhere.
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.My clothes are wet, tight on my skin.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.

Accept it with pride.

Came to an end.
We forgave the Germans.
And then we were friends.
Though they murdered six million.
In the ovens they fried.
The Germans now, too.
Have God on their side.I've learned to hate the Russians.
All through my whole life.
If another war comes.
It's them we must fight.
To hate them and fear them.
To run and to hide.
And accept it all bravely.

Of chemical dust.
If fire them, we're forced to.
Then fire, them we must.

When a young boy from Chicago town.
Walked in a Southern door.This boy's fateful tragedy.
You all should remember well.
The color of his skin was black.
And his name was Emmett Till.Some men, they dragged him to a barn.
And there they beat him up.
They said they had a reason.
But disremember what.They tortured him and did some things.
Too evil to repeat.
There were screaming sounds inside the barn.
There was laughing sounds out on the street.Then they rolled his body down a gulf.
Amidst a blood red rain.
And they threw him in the waters wide.
To cease his screaming pain.The reason that they killed him there.
And I'm a-sure, it ain't no lie.
'Cause he was born in black-skin barn.
He was born to die.And then to stop the United States.
Of yelling for a trial.
Two brothers, they confessed.
That they had killed poor Emmett Till.But on the jury there were men.
Who had helped the brothers commit this awful crime.
And so this trial was a mockery.
But nobody there seemed to mind.I saw the morning papers.
But I could not bear.
To see smiling brothers.
Walkin' down the courthouse stairs.For the jury found them innocent.
And the brothers, they went free.
While Emmett's body floats the foam.
Of a Jim Crow southern sea.If you can't speak out against this kind of thing.
A crime that's so unjust.
Your eyes are filled with dead men's clay.
Your ears must be filled with dust.Your arms and legs.
They must be in shackles and chains.
And your mind, it must cease to flow.
For you to let our human race.
Fall down so God-awful low.This song is just a reminder.
To remind your fellow man.

In that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.But if all of us folks that thinks alike.
If we gave all we could give.
We could make this great land of ours.
A greater place to live. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I will not go down under the ground.

The meaning of life has been lost in the wind.
And some people thinkin' that the end is close by.
Stead of learnin' to live they are learning to die.Let me die in my footsteps.

They've been talking of the war now for many long years.
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word.
But now Lord God let my poor voice be heard.Let me die in my footsteps.
Before I go down under the ground.Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood.
Let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood.
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves.
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.Let me die in my footsteps.
Before I go down under the ground.Go out in your country where the land meets the sun.

Movin' on.
You burned so bright.
Roll on, John.Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow.
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam.
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know.
Too late now to sail back home.Shine your light.
Movin' on.
You burned so bright.
Roll on, John.Tyger, tyger burning bright.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
In the forests of the night.
Cover 'em over and let him sleep.Shine your light.

But she breaks just like a little girl.Queen Mary.
She's my friend.
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess.
That Baby can't be blessed.

With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes.
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does.
And she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.It was raining from the first.
And I was dying there of thirst.
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts.
But what's worse.
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear that.I just can't fit.
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we meet again.
Introduced as friends.
Please don't let on that you knew me when.
I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do.

Walk on your tip toes.
Don't try "No Doz".
Better stay away from those.

Shadows even the silver spoon.
The handmade blade, the child's balloon.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
To understand you know too soon, there is no sense in trying.Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn.
Suicide remarks are torn.
From the fool's gold mouthpiece the hollow horn.
Plays wasted words proves to warn.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.Temptation's page flies out the door.
You follow, find yourself at war.
Watch waterfalls of pity roar.
You feel to moan but unlike before.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.So don't fear if you hear.
A foreign sound to your ear.
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.As some warn victory, some downfall.
Private reasons great or small.
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call.
To make all that should be killed to crawl.
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred.Disillusioned words like bullets bark.
As human gods aim for their mark.
Made everything from toy guns that spark.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.Our preachers preach of evil fates.
Teachers teach that knowledge waits.
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates.
Goodness hides behind its gates.
But even the President of the United States.
Sometimes must have to stand naked.An' all the rules of the road have been lodged.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.Advertising signs that con you.
Into thinking you're the one.
That can do what's never been done.
That can win what's never been won.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.You lose yourself, you reappear.
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear.
Alone you stand with nobody near.
When a trembling distant voice, unclear.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear.
That somebody thinks they really found you.A question in your nerves is lit.
Yet you know there is no answer fit.
To satisfy insure you not to quit.
To keep it in your mind and not forget.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.Although the masters make the rules.
For the wise men and the fools.
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.For them that must obey authority.
That they do not respect in any degree.
Who despise their jobs, their destinies.
Speak jealously of them that are free.
Do what they do just to be.
Nothing more than something they invest in.While some on principles baptized.
To strict party platform ties.
Social clubs in drag disguise.
Outsiders they can freely criticize.
Tell nothing except who to idolize and say, "God bless him".While one who sings with his tongue on fire.
Gargles in the rat race choir.
Bent out of shape from society's pliers.
Cares not to come up any higher.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.But I mean no harm nor put fault.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.Old lady judges watch people in pairs.
Limited in sex, they dare.
To push fake morals, insult and stare.
While money doesn't talk, it swears.
Obscenity, who really cares propaganda, all is phony.While them that defend what they cannot see.
With a killer's pride, security.
It blows the minds most bitterly.
For them that think death's honesty.
Won't fall upon them naturally.
Life sometimes must get lonely.My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards.
False goals, I scuff at pettiness which plays so rough.
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs.
Kick my legs to crash it off.
Say, "Okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me".And if my thought dreams could be seen.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb.
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb.
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace.
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race.
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up.
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup.If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on.
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone.
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it.
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it.
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long.
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong.
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day.
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away.And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'.
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'.
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys.
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys.
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'.
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'.
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'.
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'.And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm.
And to yourself you sometimes say.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born".And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat.
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet.
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air.
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare.
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying.
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'.And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet.
And you need it badly but it lays on the street.
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear it's beat.
And you think yer ears might a been hurt.
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt.
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush.
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush.And all the time you were holdin' three queens.
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean.
Like in the middle of Life magazine.
Bouncin' around a pinball machine.And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying.
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'.
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head.
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed.
And no matter how you try you just can't say it.
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it.
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head.
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead.And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth.
And his jaws start closin with you underneath.
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind.
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign.
And you say to yourself, "Just what am I doin'.
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'.
On this curve I'm hanging.
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking.
In this air I'm inhaling.Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard.
Why am I walking, where am I running.
What am I saying, what am I knowing.
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'.
On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'.
In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm thinkin'.
In the words that I'm writing.In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'.
Who am I helping, what am I breaking.
What am I giving, what am I taking.
But you try with your whole soul best.
Never to think these thoughts and never to let.
Them kind of thoughts gain ground.
Or make yer heart pound.
But then again you know why they're around.
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down."Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping.
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping.
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'.
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking.
If that was you in the dream that was screaming.
And you know that it's something special you're needin'.
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'.
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding.You need something special, you need something special, all right.
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track.
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back.
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler.
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever.
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over.You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race.
That won't laugh at yer looks, your voice or your face.
And by any number of bets in the book.
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze.
You need something to open up a new door.
To show you something you seen before.
But overlooked a hundred times or more.
You need something to open your eyes.You need something to make it known.
That it's you and no one else that owns.
That spot that yer standing.
That space that you're sitting.
That the world ain't got you beat.
That it ain't got you licked.
It can't get you crazy no matter how many.
Times you might get kicked.You need something special all right.
You need something special to give you hope.
But hope's just a word that maybe you said or maybe you heard.
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve.
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad.
And yer trouble is you know it too good.
"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills.
"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill.And it ain't on Macy's window sill.
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map.
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house.
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ.
And it ain't on that dimlit stage.
With that half-wit comedian on it.
Ranting and raving and taking yer money.
And you thinks it's funny.No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club.
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club.
And sure as hell you're bound to tell that no matter how hard you rub.
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub.
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you.
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you.
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house.
Or down any movie star's blouse.And you can't find it on the golf course.
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus.
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes.
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons.
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices.
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'.Sayin' "Ain't I pretty and ain't I cute.
Look at my skin.
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow.
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry".
When you can't even sense if they got any insides.
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows.
No you'll not now or no other day.
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache.
And inside it the people made of molasses.
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses.And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies.
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny.
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack.
And before you can count from one to ten.
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back, my friend.
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl.
And play games with each other in their sand-box world.And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools.
That run around gallant and make all rules for the ones that got talent.
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do.
And think they're foolin' you.
The ones who jump on the wagon.
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style.
To get their kicks, get out of it quick.
And make all kinds of rnoney and chicks.And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat.
Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that.
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at.
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel.
Good God Almighty that stuff ain't real.No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race.
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face.
You gotta look some other place.
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'.
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'.
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'.
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'.
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there.
And out there somewhere.
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads.Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows.
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways.
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs.
You can either go to the church of your choice.
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital.
You'll find God in the church of your choice.
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital.And though it's only my opinion.
I may be right or wrong.
You'll find them both.

And it's all over now, baby blue.The highway is for gamblers.
Better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered.
From coincidence.The empty handed painter from your streets.
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you.
And it's all over now, baby blue.All your seasick sailors.
They are rowing home.
Your empty handed army.
Is all going home.Your lover, who just walked out the door.
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet too, is moving under you.
And it's all over now, baby blue.Leave your stepping stones behind.
Now, something that calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left.
They will not follow you.The vagabond who's rapping at your door.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew.

She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon.
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame.
You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim.
If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came.
Because the cops don't need you, and man, they expect the same.Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast.
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post.
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast.
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost.I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff.
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough.

He never had enough money.
To pay his room or board.

Welfare department they wouldn't give him no clothes.
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go".
Howard said, "There's only one place I know".
Sam said, "Tell me quick man and I got to run".0ld howard just pointed with his gun.
And said, "That way down Highway 61".Well Mack the finger said to Louie the King.

And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Do you know where I can get rid of these things".
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute son".And he said, "Yes I think it can be easily done.
Just take everything down to Highway 61".Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
My complexion she says is much too white.
He said, "Come here and step into the light".
He says, "Hmm you're right.
Let me tell the second mother this has been done".But the second mother was with the seventh son.
And they were both out on Highway 61.Now the Rovin' gambler he was very bored.
He was tryin' to create a next world war.
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor.

As the evening sky grew dark.
She looked at him and he felt a spark.
Tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone.
And wished that he'd gone straight.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.They walked along by the old canal.
A little confused, I remember well.
And stopped into a strange hotel.
With a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night.
Hit him like a freight train.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.A saxophone someplace far off played.
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade.
Where he was wakin' up.
She dropped a coin into the cup.
Of a blind man at the gate.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.He woke up, the room was bare.
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care.
Pushed the window open wide.
Felt an emptiness inside.
To which he just could not relate.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.He hears the ticking of the clocks.
And walks along with a parrot that talks.
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks.
Where the sailers all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again.
How long must he wait.
One more time for a simple twist of fate.People tell me it's a sin.
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin.
But I lost the ring.
She was born in spring.
But I was born too late.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Our conversation was short and sweet.
It nearly swept me off my feet.

And you are on dry land.
You made it there somehow.
You're a big girl now.Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence.
He's singin' his song for me at his own expense.
And I'm just like that bird, oh.
Singin' just for you.
I hope that you can hear.
Hear me singin' through these tears.Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast.
Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear, oh.
See what you can do.
I can make it through.
You can make it too.Love is so simple, to quote a phrase.
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days.
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh.
In somebody's room..
It's a price I have to pay.
You're a big girl all the way. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Down the street the dogs are barkin'.
And the day is a-gettin' dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin'.

An' the silent night will shatter.

Yes, I'm one too many mornings.
And a thousand miles behind.From the crossroads of my doorstep.
My eyes they start to fade.
And I turn my head back to the room.
Where my love and I have laid.
An' I gaze back to the street.
The sidewalk and the sign.
And I'm one too many mornings.
An' a thousand miles behind.It's a restless hungry feeling.
That don't mean no one no good.
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'.
You can say it just as good.
You're right from your side.
I'm right from mine.
We're both just one too many mornings.
An' a thousand miles behind. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Oh, I'm sailin' away, my own true love.
I'm sailin' away in the morning.
Is there something I can send you from across the sea.
From the place that I'll be landing.No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love.
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled.
From across that lonesome ocean.Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine.
Made of silver or of golden.
Either from the mountains of Madrid.
Or from the coast of Barcelona.But if I had the stars from the darkest night.
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean.
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss.
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.But I might be gone a long old time.
And it's only that I'm askin'.
Is there something I can send you to remember me by.
To make your time more easy-passin'.Oh, how can, how can you ask me again.
It only brings me sorrow.
The same thing I want today.
I would want again tomorrow.Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day.
It was from her ship a-sailin'.
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again.
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.If you, my love, must think that-a-way.
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
I'm sure your heart is not with me.
But with the country to where you're goin'.So take heed, take heed of the western winds.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And yes, there's something you can send back to me.
Spanish boots of Spanish leather. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Buckets of rain.
Buckets of tears.
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand.
You got all the love.
Honey baby, I can stand.I been meek.
And hard like an oak.
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear.
If you want me.
Honey baby, I'll be here.I like your smile.
And your fingertips.
Like the way that you move your lips.
I like the cool way you look at me.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.Little red wagon.
Little red bike.
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
I like the way you love me strong and slow.
I'm takin' you with me.
Honey baby, when I go. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Standing on the waters casting your bread.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Distant ships sailing into the mist,.

Freedom just around the corner for you.
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,.
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show why.
Shedding off one more layer of skin,.
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah.

Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,.
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,.
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,.
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,.
Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,.
Take the motherless children off the street.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,.

When the children were babies and played on the beach.
You came up behind me, I saw you go by.
You were always so close and still within reach.Sara, Sara.
Whatever made you want to change your mind.
Sara, Sara.
So easy to look at, so hard to define.I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand.
They run to the water their buckets to fill.
I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands.
As they follow each other back up the hill.Sara, Sara.
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life.
Sara, Sara.
Radiant jewel, mystical wife.Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night.
Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar.
Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White.
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.Sara, Sara.
It's all so clear, I could never forget.
Sara, Sara.
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret.I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells.
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through.
Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel.
Writin' sad-eyed lady of the lowlands for you.Sara, Sara.
Wherever we travel we're never apart.
Sara, oh Sara.
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.How did I meet you I don't know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.Sara, oh Sara.
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress.
Sara, Sara.
You must forgive me my unworthiness.Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp.
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
You always responded when I needed your help.
You gimme a map and a key to your door.Sara, oh Sara.
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow.
Sara, oh Sara.
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love.
I love you more than money and more than the stars above.
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.Ever since you walked right in, the circles been complete.
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street.
To the courtyards of the jester which is hidden from the sun.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live.
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give.
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life.
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife.
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth.
Well, play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.It's never been my duty to remake the world at large.
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge.
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend.
And if there is eternity I'll love you there again.Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side.
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride.
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see.
Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me.
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on.
'Cause I love you more than ever, now that the past is gone. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I can see the turning of the key.
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain.
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost.
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill.
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love you still.I come back to the town from the flaming moon.
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.
I love to see you dress before the mirror.
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear.Everybody's wearing a disguise.
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
But me, I can't cover what I am.
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.I march in the parade of liberty.
But as long as I love you I'm not free.
How long must I suffer such abuse.
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose.I've given up the game, I've got to leave.
The pot of gold is only make-believe.
The treasure can't be found by men who search.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.We sat in an empty theater and we kissed.
I asked ya please to cross me off your list.
My head tells me it's time to make a change.
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.So one more time at midnight, near the wall.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG What's the matter with me.
I don't have much to say.
Daylight sneakin' through the window.
And I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon.
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow.
To sit down on this bank of sand.
And watch the river flow.Wish I was back in the city.
Instead of this old bank of sand.
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops.
And the one I love so close at hand.
If I had wings and I could fly.
I know where I would go.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly.
And watch the river flow.People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah.
Makes you stop and all wonder why.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street.
Who just couldn't help but cry.
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though.
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow.
And as long as it does I'll just sit here.
And watch the river flow.People disagreeing everywhere you look.
Makes you want to stop and read a book.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street.
That was really shook.
But this ol' river keeps on rollin', though.
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow.
And as long as it does I'll just sit here.
And watch the river flow. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG The eastern world it is explodin', violence flarin', bullets loadin'.

But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend.
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.Don't you understand what I'm trying to say.
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today.
If the button is pushed, there's no running away.
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave.Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy.
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend.
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'.
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'.
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation.Handful of Senators don't pass legislation.
And marches alone can't bring integration.
When human respect is disintegratin'.This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'.
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend.
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.Think of all the hate there is in Red China.
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama.
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space.
But when your return, it's the same old place.The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace.
You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace.
Hate your next-door-neighbor but don't forget to say grace.And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend.
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Up and down the block.
I'd ask him what the matter was.
But I know that he don't talk.
And the ladies treat me kindly.
And they furnish me with tape.
But deep inside my heart.
I know I can't escape.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the.
Memphis blues again.Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley.
With his pointed shoes and his bells.
Speaking to some French girl.
Who says she knows me well.
And I would send a message.
To find out if she's talked.
But the post office has been stolen.
And the mailbox is locked.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.Mona tried to tell me.
To stay away from the train line.
She said that all the railroad men.
Just drink up your blood like wine.
An' I said, "Oh, I didn't know that.
But then again, there's only one I've met.
An' he just smoked my eyelids.
An' punched my cigarette".
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.Grandpa died last week.
And now he's buried in the rocks.
But everybody still talks about how.
Badly they were shocked.
But me, I expected it to happen.
I knew he'd lost control.
When I speed built a fire on Main Street.
And shot it full of holes.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.Now the senator came down here.
Showing ev'ryone his gun.
Handing out free tickets.
To the wedding of his son.
An' me, I nearly got busted.
An' wouldn't it be my luck.
To get caught without a ticket.
And be discovered beneath a truck.
Oh, Mama, is this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.Now the tea preacher looked so baffled.
When I asked him why he dressed.
With twenty pounds of headlines.
Stapled to his chest.
But he cursed me when I proved it to him.
Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
You see, you're just like me.
I hope you're satisfied".
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.Now the rainman gave me two cures.
Then he said, "Jump right in".
The one was Texas medicine.
The other was just railroad gin.
An' like a fool I mixed them.
An' it strangled up my mind.
An' now people just get uglier.
An' I have no sense of time.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again.And when Ruthie says come see her.
In her honky-tonk lagoon.
Where I can watch her waltz for free.
'neath her Panamanian moon.
An' I say, "Aw come on now.
You know you knew about my debutante".
An' she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need.
But I know what you want".
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.

Where the neon madmen climb.
They all fall there so perfectly.
It all seems so well timed.
An' here I sit so patiently.
Waiting to find out what price.
You have to pay to get out of.
Going through all these things twice.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end.
To be stuck inside of Mobile.
With the Memphis blues again. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG My love, she speaks like silence.
Without ideals or violence.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
People carry roses.
And make promises by the hour.
My love she laughs like the flowers.
Valentines can't buy her.In the dime stores and bus stations.
People talk of situations.
Read books, repeat quotations.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future.
My love, she speaks softly.
She knows there's no success like failure.
And that failure's no success at all.The cloak and dagger dangles.
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of matchsticks.
Crumble into one another.
My love winks she does not bother.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.The bridge at midnight trembles.
The country doctor rambles.
Bankers' nieces seek perfection.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
The wind howls like a hammer.
The night wind blows cold n' rainy.
My love, she's like some raven.
At my window with a broken wing. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms.
You should not treat me like a stranger.
Our Father would not like the way that you act.
And you must realize the danger.Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you.
And one deserving of affection.
And is our purpose not the same on this earth.
To love and follow his direction.We grew up together.
From the cradle to the grave.
We died and were reborn.
And then mysteriously saved.Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, he hands you a nickel.
He hands you a dime.
He asks you with a grin.
If you're havin' a good time.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar.
Out in your face just for kicks.
His bedroom window.
It is made out of bricks.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants.
About man and God and law.
Everybody says.
She's the brains behind Pa.
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four.

We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it.
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
In this room the heat pipes just cough.
The country music station plays soft.
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off.
Just Louise and her lover so entwined.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain.
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight.
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Louise, she's all right, she's just near.
She's delicate and seems like the mirror.
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear.
That Johanna's not here.
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously.
And when bringing her name up.
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all.
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall.
How can I explain.
It's so hard to get on.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial.
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues.
You can tell by the way she smiles.
See the primitive wallflower freeze.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez, I can't find my knees".
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Come gather 'round people wherever you roam.
Admit that the waters around you have grown.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you is worth savin'.
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone.
For the times they are a-changin'.Come writers and critics who prophetize with your pen.
Keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again.
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin.
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
For the loser now might be later to win.
For the times they are a-changin'.Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls.
For the times they are a-changin'.Come mothers and fathers throughout the land.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command.
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand.
For the times they are a-changin'. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I married Isis on the fifth day of May.
But I could not hold on to her very long.
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away.
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.I came to a high place of darkness and light.
Dividing line ran through the center of town.
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.A man in the corner approached me for a match.
I knew right away he was not ordinary.
He said, are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch.
Said, I got no money, he said, that ain't necessary.We set out that night for the cold in the North.
I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word.
I said, where are we goin', he said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said, that's the best news that I've ever heard.I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold.
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace.
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold.
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.How she told me that one day we would meet up again.
And things would be different the next time we wed.
If I only could hang on and just be her friend.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.
He said, there's a body I'm tryin' to find.
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had.
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly.
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.I picked up his body and I dragged him inside.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.She said, where ya been I said, no place special.
She said, you look different, I said, well, I guess.
She said, you been gone, I said, that's only natural.
She said, you gonna stay I said, yeah, I might do.Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child.
What drives me to you is what drives me insane.
I still can remember the way that you smiled.

Then says the judge, says he.
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you.
Across the stormy sea.
But take a tip before you ship.
To join the iron gang.
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay.
Or else you'll surely hang.
Or else you'll surely hang," says he.
"And after that, Jim Jones.
It's high above on the gallows tree.
The crows will pick your bones".And our ship was high upon the sea.
When pirates came along.
But the soldiers on our convict ship.
Were full five hundred strong.
For they opened fire and somehow drove.
That pirate ship away.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship.
Than gone to Botany Bay.
With the storms ragin' round us.
And the winds a-blowin' gale.
I'd rather have drowned in misery.
Than gone to New South Wales.
There's no time for mischief there they say.
Remember that, says they.
Or they'll flog the poaching out of you.
Down there in Botany Bay.Now it's day and night and the irons clang.
And like poor galley slaves.
We toil and toil, and when we die.
Must fill dishonored graves.
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains.
Into the bush I'll go.
And I'll join the bravest rankers there.
Jack Donohue and co.
And some dark night, when everything.
Is silent in the town.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all.
I'll gun the flogger down.
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock.
Remember what I say.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones.
In chains to Botany Bay. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG While riding on a train goin' west.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.With half-damp eyes I stared to the room.
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon.
Where we together weathered many a storm.
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung.
Our words were told, our songs were sung.
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied.
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside.With hungry hearts through the heat and cold.
We never thought we could ever get old.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
But our chances really was a million to one.As easy it was to tell black from white.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And our choices they was few so the thought never hit.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.How many a year has passed and gone.
Many a gamble has been lost and won.
And many a road taken by many a first friend.
And each one I've never seen again.I wish, I wish, I wish in vain.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Farewell Angelina the bells on the crown.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow.
But farewell Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.There is use in talking and there's no need for blame.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
A table stands empty by the edge of the stream.
But farewell Angelina, the sky is changing colors and I must leave.The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard.
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard.
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild.
Farewell Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.See the cross eyed pirates sit perched in the sun.
Shooting tin cans with a sawed off shot gun.
And the corporals and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast.
But farewell Angelina, the sky is trembling and I must leave fast.King Kong, little elves and the roof-tops they dance.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Shut the eyes of the dead, not to embarrass anyone.
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over and I must be gone.The camouflaged parrot, he flutters from fear.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
What cannot be imitated perfect must die.
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over and I must go where it is dry.Machine guns are roaring, the puppets heave rocks.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it.
But farewell Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Childhood living is easy to do.

Now you decided to show me the same.
No sweeping exits or offstage lines.
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind.Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away.I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie.
I have my freedom but I don't have much time.
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried.
Let's do some living, after we die.Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day.

Imaginin' the world has stopped.Then in flies a guy.
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack.
And says, I've won five pounds.

I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line".
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you.
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine".It's three a.m., there's too much noise.
Don't you people ever wanna go to bed.

Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
Don't hang around boy two's a crowd.

And decided to take a drive downtown.
It was so very quiet and peaceful.
There was nobody, not a soul around.I laid myself out.
I was so tired and I started to dream.
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like a flag.
Stuck on my windscreen.I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
Don't hang around boy two's a crowd.
On my cloud".Hey, you, get off of my cloud.

A Kiss Is Just A Kiss .Lyrics and Music by Herman Hupfeld;.
1931 Warner Bros. Music Corp., ASCAP.
This day and age we're living in.
Gives cause for apprehension.
With speed and new invention.
And things like fourth dimension.
Yet we get a trifle weary.
With Mr. Einstein's theory.
So we must get down to earth at times.
Relax relieve the tension.
And no matter what the progress.
Or what may yet be proved.
The simple facts of life are such.
They cannot be removed.
You must remember this.
A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.
The fundamental things apply.
As time goes by.
And when two lovers woo.
They still say, "I love you".
On that you can rely.
No matter what the future brings.
As time goes by.
Moonlight and love songs.
Never out of date.
Hearts full of passion.
Jealousy and hate.
Woman needs man.
And man must have his mate.
That no one can deny.
Well, it's still the same old story.
A fight for love and glory.
A case of do or die.
The world will always welcome lovers.
As time goes by.
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers.
As time goes by. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG -"One sentence about the next act..

I've come to talk with you again.
Because a vision softly creeping.
Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
And the vision that was planted in my brain.
Still remains.

Narrow streets of cobblestone.
'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
I turned my collar to the cold and damp.
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light.
That split the night.
And touched the sound of silence.And in the naked light I saw.
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking.
People hearing without listening.
People writing songs that voices never share.
And no one dared.
Disturb the sound of silence."Fools" said I.
"You do not know, silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you".

I'm with my troops, yeah.
And down along the avenue.
Some guys were shooting pool.
And I heard the sound.
Of a cappella groups, yeah.
Singing late in the evening.
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah.Then I learned to play some lead guitar.
I was underage in this funky bar.
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J".
And when I came back to the room.
Everybody just seemed to move.
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play.
And it was late in the evening.
And I blew that room away.The first thing I remember.
When you came into my life.
I said I'm gonna get that girl.
No matter what I do.

I should go to bed but a voice in my head.
Says, "Ah, what the Hell".Have a good time.

Have a good time.
Have a good time.Paranoia strikes deep in the heartland.
But I think it's all overdone.
Exaggerating this and exaggerating that.
They don't have no fun.I don't believe what I read in the papers.
They're just out to capture my dime.
I ain't worrying and I ain't scurrying.
I'm having a good time.Have a good time.

Have a good time.
Have a good time.Maybe I'm laughing my way to disaster.
Maybe my race has been run.
Maybe I'm blind to the fate of mankind.
But what can be done.So God bless the goods we was given.
And God bless the U. S. of A..
And God bless our standard of livin'.
Let's keep it that way and we'll all have a good time.Have a good time.

Can't run but.I can't run but.
I can walk much faster than this.
Can't run but.I had a dream about us.
In the bottles and the bones of the night.
I felt a pain in my shoulder blade.
'Twas like a pencil point, a love bite.A couple was rubbing against us.
Rubbing and doing that new dance.
The man was wearing a jacket and jeans.
The woman was laughing in advance.I can't run but.
I can walk much faster than this.
Can't run but.I can't run but.

Cannot run but.A winding river.
Gets wound around a heart, pull it.

Though my story's seldom told,.
I have squandered my resistance.
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises.
All lies and jests.
Still a man hears what he wants to hear.
And disregards the rest.When I left my home and my family,.
I was no more than a boy.
In the company of strangers.
In the quiet of the railway station,.
Running scared,.
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters.
Where the ragged people go.
Looking for the places.
Only they would know.Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie.
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie.Asking only workman's wages.
I come looking for a job,.
But I get no offers,.
Just a come-on from the whores.
On Seventh Avenue.
I do declare,.
There were times when I was so lonesome.
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le.Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie.
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie.Then I'm laying out my winter clothes.
And wishing I was gone,.
Going home.
Where the New York City winters.
Aren't bleeding me,.
Leading me,.
Going home.In the clearing stands a boxer,.
And a fighter by his trade.
And he carries the reminders.
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down.
Or cut him till he cried out.
In his anger and his shame,.
"I am leaving, I am leaving".
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm.Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie.

Two people playing the game.
Negotiations and love songs.
Are often mistaken for one and the same.Now the man and the woman.

With disagreements about.
The meaning of a marriage contract.Conversations hard and wild.
From time to time he make sher laugh.

It's just apartment house sense.It's like apartment rents.
Remember one man's ceiling is another man's floor I'll tell you.
One man's ceiling is another man's floor.There's an alley in the back of my building.
Where some people congregate in shame.

Old friends, winter companions, the old men.
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun.
The sounds of the city sifting through trees.
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends.
Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly.
How terribly strange to be seventy.
Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears..Time it was and what a time it was it was....
A time of innocence a time of confidences.

Mistaking value for the price.

Overlooking the parking lot.
Pointing at a figure in the distance.
Dr. King has just been shot.And the sirens long melody.
Singing savior pass me not.

And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.Homeward bound, I wish I was homeward bound.
Home, where my thoughts escape, at home, where my music's playin'.
Home, where my love lies waitin' silently for me.Every day's an endless dream of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories.
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be.Homeward bound, I wish I was homeward bound.
Home, where my thoughts escape, at home, where my music's playin'.
Home, where my love lies waitin' silently for me.Tonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me, in shades of mediocrity.
Like emptiness and harmony, I need someone to comfort me.Homeward bound, oh I wish I was homeward bound.
Home, where my thoughts escape, where my music's playin'.
Where my love lies waitin' silently for me, silently for me. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Slow down, you move too fast..

Wouldn't play it by the book.
Maybe let us off the hook.

Guilty by my dress, guilty in the press.
Let The Capeman burn for the murder.Well the "Spanish boys" had their day in court.
And now it was time for some fuckin' law and order.
The electric chair, for the greasy pair.
Said the judge to the court reporter.Afraid to leave the projects.
To cross into another neighborhood.
The newspapers and the T.V. crews.
Well, they'd kill you if they could.Angel of Mercy, people are suffering.
All over the world.
A Spanish boy could be killed.
Every night of the week.But just let some white boy die.
And the world goes crazy.
For blood-Latin blood.
I don't lie when I speak.Well, they shackled my hands.
A heavy belt around my waist to restrain me.
And they shackled my legs.
Hernandez, the "Umbrella Man," chained beside me.Then we rode that Black Maria.
Through the streets of Spanish Harlem.
Calling old friends on the corners.
Just to lay our prayers upon them.Crying, adios Hermanos, Adios.

First time I heard "Satisfaction", I was young and unemployed.
Down the decades every year summer leaves and my birthday's here.
And all my friends stand up and cheer.And say, "Man you're old.
Getting old, old, getting old".We celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas Day.
And Buddah found Nirvana along the Lotus Way.
About 1,500 years ago the messenger Mohammed spoke.
And his wisdom, like a river flowed through hills of gold.Wisdom is old, the Koran is old.
The Bible's is old, greatest story ever told.Disagreements.
Work 'em out.The human race has walked the earth for 2.7 million.
And we estimate the universe about 13 to 14 billion.

My heart can take a disgrace.

Songs from the mouth of the river when the world was young.
And all of these spirit voices rule the night.By moon we walk to the Brujo's door.
Along a path of river stones.
Women with their nursing children seated on the floor.
We join the fevers and the broken bones.Candlelight flickers the falcon calls.
A lime green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall.
And all of these spirit voices.Sing rain water, sea water, river water, holy water.
Wrap this child in mercy heal her.
Heaven's only daughter.
All of these spirit voices rule the night.My hands were numb, my feet were lead.

And she moves on.And I know the reason I feel so blessed.
My heart still splashes inside my chest.
But she, she is like a top, she cannot stop.
She moves on.A sympathetic stranger.
Lights a candle in the middle of the night.
Her voice cracks, she jumps back.
But she moves on.She says, ''Oh my storybook lover.
You have underestimated my power.
As you shortly will discover''.Then I fall to my knees.
Shake a rattle at the skies.
And I'm afraid that I'll be taken abandoned and forsaken.
In her cold coffee eyes.She can't sleep now the moon is red.
She fights a fever, she burns in bed.
She needs to talk so we take a walk.
Down in the maroon light.She says, "Maybe these emotions are.
As near to love as love will ever be''.
So I agree, then the moon breaks.
She takes the corner, that's all she takes.
She moves on.She says, ''Oh my storybook lover.
You have underestimated my power.
As you shortly will discover''.Then I fall to my knees.
I grow weak, I go slack.
As if she captured the breath of my voice.
In a bottle and I can't catch it back.
No, no, no.But I feel good, it's a fine day.
The way the sun hits off the runway.
A cloud shifts, the plane lifts.
She moves on, on and on. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I was born in Puerto Rico.
We came here when I was a child.
Before I reached the age of sixteen.
I was runnin' with the gang and we were wild.He keeps lookin' but he don't recognize me.
Some guy from Lexington or Park.
Red beans and rice from kitchen windows.
It's supper time and the barrio is dark.No one knows you like I do.
Nobody can know your heart the way I do.
No one can testify to all that you've been through.
But I will.I was born in Puerto Rico and my blood is Taino.
Spanish Caribbean, my soul.
We came here wearing summer clothes in winter.
Hearts of sunshine in the cold.Your family rented this apartment.
You'd watch the street lamps from your perch.
In the sacramental hour, your stepfather in black.
Preached the fire of the Pentecostal Church.No one knows you like I do.
Nobody can know your heart the way I do.
No one to testify to all that you've been through.
But this will.I was born in Puerto Rico.
Came here when I was a child.
Small change and sunlight.
Then I left these streets for good.
My days as short as they were wild.Your features blurred in every grainy photo.
And fading headline of the Daily News.
Wiltwyck School for Criminal Children.
Auburn, Brooklyn House of D.
Dannemora, Sing Sing, Attica, Greenhaven.
Twenty years inside, today you're free.You cannot even read your story.
The pages piling up in shame.
Before the words released you.
The guard would kill the light.
The night you took The Capeman for your name.I was born in Puerto Rico.
I was born in Puerto Rico.
I was born in Puerto Rico.
I was born in Puerto Rico.I was born in Puerto Rico.
I was born in Puerto Rico.

Well that's good luck.
Running through young veins.
And if life is a blessing.

Well it's a short walk.
In a sweet breeze.I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you.
All for the taste of your sweet love thelma.
If a heart is an open memory book.
That was the chance I took.
The more I searched, the more shook with thelma.
Last night I slept on a rented pillow.
A silver moon above my head.
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me.
And I reached for the phone.
By the side of the bed.Now the first time that I saw you I thought.
"she's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught".
People aware of my history.
Trying to steer you away from me.
I left a message at your hotel.
Don't let management poison the well.I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you.
All for the taste of your sweet love thelma.The phone is ringing and I realize.
We are timezones and oceans apart.
The words I speak in the middle of my night.
They fall on your yesterday scars.If the sun don't shine, the wind don't break.
The clock don't jump off the wall.
Thelma, my darling, I will cushion your fall.
I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you.
Without the taste of your sweet love thelma.I am only a man who has skirted the edge of despair.
For a long time now, and I don't care.I watch you sleeping a the hospital bed.
The baby curled up in a ball.
Winter sunlight hits the family tree.
And everything else becomes nothing at all. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Tom, get your plane right on time.

Like a memory it falls..
Soft and warm,.
Continuing.
Tapping on my roof and walls..And from the shelter of my mind.
Through the window of my eyes.
I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets.
To England, where my heart lies..My mind's distracted and diffused.
My thoughts are many miles away..
They lie with you when you're asleep,.
Kiss you when you start your day..
And a song I was writing is left undone.I don't know why I spend my time.
Writing songs I can't believe,.
With words that tear and strain to rhyme..And so you see I have come to doubt,.
All that I once held as true.
I stand alone without beliefs,.
The only truth I know is you..And as I watch the drops of rain.
Weave their weary paths and die.
I know that I am like the rain-.

Through restful waters and deep commotion.
Often frightened, unenlightened.
Sail on, sail on sailor.I wrest the waters, fight Neptunes waters.
Sail through the sorrows of lifes marauders.
Unrepenting, often empty.
Sail on, sail on sailor.Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail.
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail.Seldom stumble, never crumble.
Try to tumble, lifes a rumble.
Feel the stinging, Ive been given.
Never ending, unrelenting.
Heartbreak searing, always fearing.
Never caring, persevering.
Sail on, sail on, sailor.I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways.
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters.
Uninspired, drenched and tired.
Wail on, wail on, sailor.Always needing, even bleeding.
Never feeding all my feelings.
Damn the thunder, must I blunder.
Theres no wonder all Im under.
Stop the crying and the lying.
And the sighing and my dying.Sail on, sail on sailor.
Sail on, sail on sailor.
Sail on, sail on sailor.

I don't want to cause no fuss .
But can I buy your Magic Bus .Nooooooooo.I don't care how much I pay .
I wanna drive my bus to my baby each day .

And a hundred miles square of land to churn about.
My old horse is weary but sincerely.
I believe that he can pull a plough.Well, I've moved into the jungle.
Of the agriculture rumble to grow my own food.
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds.
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through.Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging.
Digging, digging, digging, digging.
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging.
Digging, digging, digging, digging.It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming.
How calming and balming the effect of the air.Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn.
That stretched as far as the eye can see.
That's a whole lot of cornflakes.
Near enough to feed New York till 1973.Cultivation is my station and the nation.
Buys my corn from me immediately.
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks.
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea.Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging.
Digging, digging, digging, digging.
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging.
Digging, digging, digging, digging.It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming.
How calming and balming the effect of the air.Now look here, son, the right thing to say.
Isn't necessarily what you want to say.
The right thing to do.
Isn't necessarily what you want to do.The right things to grow.
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow.
Your own happiness.
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know.Well, I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse.
And my hands are deeply grained.
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing.
Just how lazily he took the strain.Well, my pick and spade are rusty.
Because I'm paid on trust.
To leave my square of cornfield bare.It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming.
How calming and balming the effect of the air.When you grow what I grow.
Tomatoes, potatoes, stew, eggplants.
Potatoes, tomatoes, gourds. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man.
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.The kids all would sing, he would take the wrong key.
So they rode on his head with their furry donkey.But they never stopped Jack in the water lapping.
And they couldn't distract him from the sea gulls flapping.The kids couldn't hurt Jack.
They tried and tried and tried.
They dropped things on his back.
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied.They never stopped Jack nor the water lapping.

And words when you played your guitar.
The noise that I was hearing.
Was a million people cheering.
And a child flew past me riding in a star.Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup.
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy.
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness.
The note that began all, can also destroy.We all know success when we all find our own dreams.
And our love is enough to knock down any walls.
And the future's been seen as men try to realize.
The simple secret of the note in us all.I listened and I heard music in a word.
And words when you played your guitar.
The noise that I was hearing.
Was a million people cheering.
And a child flew past me riding in a star.There once was a note, pure and easy.
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.There once was a note, listen.

We put all our money on a dog that we like.
A kiss and a cuddle an' hot meat pie.
Two dollar tickets and a starry sky.There was nothing in my life bigger than beer.
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer.
Exceptin' you little darling, exceptin' you little darling.
We're a happy couple you and me.
With a baby at either knee.Yes it's you little darling.
Yes it's you little darling.
Now it's you little darling.
Now it's you.Where's me wage packet I need it.
Ah I'll put twenty-five knicker please on yellow printer.
Oh, I hope the wife don't find out.
Yes, it's sure to win, isn't it.
Yes, I know, it's a good dog, I saw it run at White City.
Just last week, broke the record, yellow printer.
Nice dog, yes, lovely form, lovely buttocks. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG We'll be fighting in the streets.
With our children at our feet.
And the morals that they worship will be gone.
And the men who spurred us on.
Sit in judgment of all wrong.
They decide and the shotgun sings the song.I'll tip my hat to the new constitution.
Take a bow for the new revolution.
Smile and grin at the change all around.
Pick up my guitar and play.
Just like yesterday.
Then I'll get on my knees and pray.
We don't get fooled again.The change, it had to come.
We knew it all along.
We were liberated from the fold, that's all.
And the world looks just the same.
And history ain't changed.
'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war.I'll tip my hat to the new constitution.
Take a bow for the new revolution.
Smile and grin at the change all around.
Pick up my guitar and play.
Just like yesterday.
Then I'll get on my knees and pray.
We don't get fooled again.
No, no.I'll move myself and my family aside.
If we happen to be left half alive.
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky.
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie.
Do ya.There's nothing in the streets.
Looks any different to me.
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye.
And the parting on the left.
Are now parting on the right.
And the beards have all grown longer overnight.I'll tip my hat to the new constitution.
Take a bow for the new revolution.
Smile and grin at the change all around.
Pick up my guitar and play.
Just like yesterday.
Then I'll get on my knees and pray.
We don't get fooled again.
Don't get fooled again.
No, no.Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.Meet the new boss.
Same as the old boss. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Down at the Astoria the scene was changing.
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating.
We were the first band to vomit in the bar.
And find the distance to the stage too far.Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock.
Rock is dead they say, long live rock.Long live rock, I need it every night.
Long live rock, come on and join the line.
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving.
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins.
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong.
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone.Back in the pub the governor stops the clock.
Rock is dead they say, long live rock.Long live rock, I need it every night.
Long live rock, come on and join the line.
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.Landslide, rocks are falling.
Falling down 'round our very heads.
We tried but you were yawning.
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.The place is really jumping to the high watt amps.
Till a 20 inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps.
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle.
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles.Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock.
Rock is dead they say, long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.Long live rock, I need it every night.
Long live rock, come on join the line.
Long live rock, be it dead or alive. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG You can hear it in the street, see it in the dragging feet.
The word is gettin' out about control.
Spies they've come and gone, the story travels on.
The only quiet place is inside your soul.From tree to tree, from you to me.
Travelin' twice as fast as on any freeway.
Every single dream, wrapped up in the scheme.
They all get carried on the relay.Relay, things are brewin'.
Relay, something's doin'.
Relay, there's a revolution.
Relay, relay.
.
Pass it on, come on, a relay.Someone disapproves, what you say and do.
I was asked to see what I could really learn you.
Don't believe your eyes, they're tellin' only lies.
What is done in the first place don't concern you.From tree to tree, from you to me.
Travelin' twice as fast as on any freeway.
Every single dream wrapped up in the scheme.
They all get carried on the relay.Relay, things are brewin'.
Relay, something's doin'.
Relay, there's a revolution.
Relay, relay.
.
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on, hey you, pass it on.We're on the relay, get a movin'.
Get on a movin' on.
The relay, the relay.
The relay, the relay. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG I don't mind your love, love.
I don't mind the one you're thinkin' of.
I know, I know.
You gonna miss me.I don't mind your love so sound.
I don't mind, it can't go cold.
I know, I know.
You gonna miss me.I don't mind, it's the end of my song.
I don't mind, good-bye, so long.
I know, said, baby I know.
You gonna miss me. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG It's not enough.
Whatever you give.A little bit more than you always need.
A little more man and a little more seed.It's not enough, it's not enough.
.
Whatever I give.
.I gave you cash, I gave you love.
All that I heard was, "It's not enough".
I worked so hard to get so tough.
Whatever I give, it never feels like enough, not enough.It's not enough, it's not enough.
Whatever I give.
.When I'm on my knees, I keep taking your stuff.
You make sure that I know it'll never be enough.
You said you'd go as far as turn to my friend.
Who once warned me of you, said you'd hasten my end.He'll choose you over me because I have lent.
Every ounce of my juice, my essence is spent.
You'll always want a little more pink.
I always need a little more ink, it's not enough..
No, it's never enough.
.
Whatever I give.However I praise, however I puff.
Though you may smile, it won't be enough.
But in the end when I start to bluff.
The lift's going down and I start actin' too tough, it's not enough..
Whatever I give, it's not enough.
.I'll find someone else to finish filling me up.
I'll smile and admit you were never quite enough.
Like Brigitte Bardot in Godard's Les Mepris.
I can't love you enough to make you complete.You appear in my dreams with some new cortier.
You need me there to see.
What you need to convey, it's not enough..
No, no, it's not enough.
.No hysterical scene.
You ain't never played rough.
I was one who can scream.
.
But it won't be enough.
.No, it's ever enough.
It's never enough.Whatever I give.
.
Whatever I give.
.
It'll never be enough of you, baby.
.
No, no.
.I'll never hold you.
.
How can I scold you.
.
Whatever I give.
.
. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG There are men high up there fishing.
Haven't seen quite enough of the world.
Ooh, I ain't seen a sign of my heroes.
And I'm still diving down for pearls.Oh, let me flow into the ocean.
Yeah, let me get back to the sea.
Let me be stormy and let me be calm.
Let the tide in and set me free.I'm flowing under bridges.
Then flying through the sky.
I'm traveling down cold metal.
Just a tear in a baby's eye.Oh, let me flow into the ocean.
Oh, let me get back to the sea.
Oh, let me be stormy and let me be calm.
Let the tide in and set me free, set me free.I am not the actor.
This can't be the scene.
But I am in the water.
As far as I can see.Oh, I'm remembering distant memories.
Recalling other names.
Rippling over canyons.
And boiling in the train.Oh, let me flow into the ocean.
Let me get back to the sea.
Let me be stormy and let me be calm.
Let the tide in and set me free, set me free.Set me free, I wanna drown in cold water. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG If you're troubled and you can't relax.
Close your eyes and think on this.
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts.
Close your eyes and think on this.Armenia, city in the sky.
Armenia, city in the sky.If you ever want to lose some time.
Just take off, there's no risk.
If you ever want to disappear.
Just take off and think of this.Armenia, city in the sky.
Armenia, city in the sky.The sky is glass but the sea is brown.
And everyone is upside down.Armenia, city in the sky.
Armenia, city in the sky.Freak out.
Freak out. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.I've got my clipboard, text books, lead me to the station.
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war.
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots I'm runnin' in the rain.
Gonna run till my feet are raw.Slip kid, slip kid, second generation.
And I'm a soldier at thirteen.
Slip kid, slip kid, realization.
There's no easy way to be free.
No easy way to be free.It's a hard, hard world.I left my doctor's prescription.
Bungalow behind me I left the door ajar.
I left my vacuum flask full of hot tea and sugar.
Left the keys right in my car.Slip kid, slip kid, second generation.
Only half way up the tree.
Slip kid, slip kid, I'm a relation.
I'm a soldier at sixty-three.
No easy way to be free..
.
Keep away old man, you won't fool me.
.
You and your history won't rule me.
.
You might have been a fighter, but admit you failed.
.
I'm not affected by your blackmail, you won't blackmail me.I've got my clipboard, text books, lead me to the station.
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war.
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots, I'm runnin' in the rain.
Gonna run till my feet are raw.Slip kid, slip kid, slip out of trouble.
Slip over here and set me free.
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation.
You're slidin' down the hill like me.
No easy way to be free.

No easy way to be free.

No easy way to be free.

.... ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG When you move in right up close to me.
That's when I get the shakes all over me.Quivers down my backbone.
I got the shakes in the knee bone.
Quivers in a backbone.
Like a shake in a hollow bone.That's what happens when you say goodnight to me.
Bring this feeling all inside of me.Quivers down my backbone.
I got the shakes in the knee bone.
Quivers in a backbone.
Like a shake in a hollow bone.Quiver backbone.Quivers down my backbone.
I got the shakes in the knee bone.
Quivers in a backbone.
Like a shake in a hollow bone. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.
We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.There's miles of frankfurters and people who hurt us in Germany.
We haven't played since yesterday.
There's just ten more shows and one week to go.
We'd all like to go.We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.
We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.Great piles of Spaghetti, bad vibes like confetti in Italy.
We go by train and not by plane.
We'd come home by car if it wasn't too far.
To drive home by car.Hope you're well at home.
Next week I'll try to phone.
Not very long to go.
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know.We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.
We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.There's lots of French fries, disapproving eyes in the U.S.A.
We've had no shows since I don't know.
There's just one thing wrong, we've been here too long.
The money's all gone.We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.
We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia.
Thrown off the plane for drinking beer.
So long on the plane it drove us insane.
So long on the plane.Hope you're well at home.
Next week I'll try to phone.
Not very long to go.
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know.We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.
We're having a lovely time.
Wish you were here.We've done very well.
But we've been to hell and heaven as well. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Run, run, run.
Run, run, run.
Run, run, run.
Run, run, run.Well baby, better take my advice.
A black cat crossed your path twice.
The moon came out next to the 1.
Then you opened your umbrella in a room.Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know.
And you won't get luckier the way you're going.
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked.
You walk under ladders then you walk right back.When you dropped that little pin.
Never thought what a mess it'd get you in.
Little pin, little pin, bring me luck.
Because I stopped to pick you up.Well now, little girl, I'm helping you.
I hope you believe what I say is true.
Whenever you run, I'll be running too.
Whenever you run, I'll be following you.Run, run, run. ENDOFSONG   STARTOFSONG Captain Walker didn't come home.
His unborn child will never know him.Believe him missing, with a number of men.
Don't expect to see him again.It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy.
